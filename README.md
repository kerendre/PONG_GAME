# PONG_GAME

This project is a digital recreation of the classic game of Pong, where two players can compete against each other in a simulated game of table tennis.
Each player controls a paddle on either the left or right side of the screen, using it to hit a ball back and forth. 
The game is simple yet challenging, providing hours of entertainment for players of all skill levels.
Whether you're a seasoned pro or a newcomer to the game, you're sure to have a great time playing Pong with this project.
